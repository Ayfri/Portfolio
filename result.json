with every feature I want to add.<br>\nSo feel free to watch this repo for futures releases!\nFor now, it offers :\n\n- Command Handling\n- SubCommand Handling\n- Event Handling\n- Default message event & help command\n- A complete Logger\n- Some utilities function for errors, jsons and other\n\n**For more information on how to use it, see the Guide and the Documentation :**\n\n-

Basic CommandHandler\n\nThis is a simple Command Handler using `module.exports` for a configuration, run function and help module for a help command auto-generated.\n\nI'd advice you to know JavaScript and Node.js before using it.<br>\nYou'll understand that this Command Handler is very basic and for a big projet you should probably use a better one.<br>\nI can recommend you the other one I've made : [Advanced Command Handler](https://github.com/Advanced-Command-Handler/Advanced-Command-Handler).\n\n## How to use it\n\nSimply clone this repo.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Ayfri/Basic-CommandHandler\n```\nSet the [configuration](#Configuration) and you're ready to go.\n\nIf you want to use Discord.js v12, use this command instead.\n```bash\ngit clone -b v12 https://github.com/Ayfri/Basic-CommandHandler\n```\nIt will clone the `v12` branch of this repo.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo start the bot you have to start with NodeJS the `main.js` file. If you want the bot to be sharded, start with le `index.js` file.

**Note:<br>This package is bundled with PIXI `v6.0.4`, you don't have to install it.**\n\n## Installation\n\n[`npm i -s pixi-extended`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-extended) <br>\nYou can use this package with TypeScript.\n\n## Features\n\n-   Enhanced classes that extends default PIXI ones to better use them.\n-   Enhanced event handling strictly typed.\n-   Fully typed in TypeScript, with strict events using custom EventEmitter class.\n-   Some utility collisions/maths classes and functions.\n-   Mouse/Keyboard support with a class & functions.\n-   Other utility classes/objects for PIXI.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nimport {Color, FPSCounter, loadTexture, PIXI, Sprite} from 'pixi-extended';\n\nconst app = new PIXI.Application({\n\tbackgroundColor: Color.BLACK.toHex(),\n});\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(app.view);\n\nasync function start() {\n\tawait loadTexture('myTexture', 'textures/myTexture.png');\n\n\tconst red = Color.RED;\n\tconst sprite = new Sprite('myTexture');\n\tsprite.color = red;\n\n\tconst fpsCounter = new FPSCounter();\n\tfpsCounter.addToApplication(app);\n\n\tsprite.addToApplication(app);\n}\n\nstart();\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation is automatically generated and updated from the code using GitHub workflows.<br>\n[You can find it here.](https://ayfri.github.io/PIXI-Extended/index.html) <br>\nThe code is on the [`docs`

Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Ayfri/PIXI-Kotlin/Kotlin%20CI?style=flat-square)\n![Sonatype Nexus

Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/pixi.js-6.5.2-blue?style=flat-square&logo=npm)\n\n# PIXI-Kotlin\n\nThis is a simple example of what a [PIXI.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs) transcription in Kotlin could look like.\n\nFor now, there are all the classes, interfaces, enums, functions, type aliases, and objects. The private members are not present.\n\nThe types are from [`PIXI 6.5.2`](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases/tag/v6.5.2).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use it in a project, just add this to your dependencies:\n\n```kotlin\nrepositories {\n\t...\n\tmavenLocal()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\timplementation(\"io.github.ayfri:PIXI-Kotlin:VERSION\")\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to add optional PIXI modules, you have to implement them in your project.\n\n```kotlin\nconst val PIXI_KOTLIN_VERSION = \"VERSION\"\n\ndependencies {\n\timplementation(\"io.github.ayfri:PIXI-Kotlin:PIXI_KOTLIN_VERSION\")\n\timplementation(\"io.github.ayfri:PIXI-Kotlin-unsafe-eval:PIXI_KOTLIN_VERSION\")\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nSimple application with a sprite, size change when clicking.\n\n```kotlin\nfun main() {\n\tval app = application {\n\t\tbackgroundColor = Color(120, 200, 230)\n\t\tresizeTo = window\n\t}\n\tapp.addToBody()\n\t\n\tval

included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.\nUseful Gradle tasks and flags:\n\n- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.\n- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.\n- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.\n- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.\n- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.\n- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.\n- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.\n- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.\n- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.\n- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.\n- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.\n- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.\n- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).\n\nNote that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.\nFor example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core`

Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Ayfri/minecraft-wiki-scrapper/Update%20versions)\n\n# VersionCraft\n\nTLDR : **VersionCraft is a website listing all versions of minecraft.**\n\nThis repo is the source of the WebSite VersionCraft, not hosted for now. It is an exhaustive list of all versions of\nminecraft, starting from pre-classic to the latest snapshots. Updated automatically every week, it is always up-to-date.\n\nIf a version is missing or some wrong information are present, please make an issue.\n\nThis project was made for a school project but will be maintained by me and maybe later published.\n\n## How information is gathered\n\nThe information is gathered from the official website of minecraft using\na [separate repo](https://github.com/Ayfri/minecraft-wiki-scrapper) that scrapes the fandom wiki. Then the information\nis parsed and cleaned, and finally the information is stored in a JSON file on GitHub. The script is re-run every week\nto update the JSON file.\n\nWhen you load the website, some JavaScript scripts will fetch the JSON file and display the information.\n\n## How to use the website\n\nGo to the website on your browser, via localhost or internet (if published, not available for now). Then select the\nversion you want to see via the dropdown list.\n\nThere you can select the snapshot or pre-release or other version of minecraft you want to see. You can download the\nversion also, a tutorial is available on the main page.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe website has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Opera. For mobile, it has been tested on Android Brave.<br>\nWe do not have exact version numbers but the browsers versions where from Q3 2021. The responsive design is imperfect,\nbut it is a good compromise, font may be a bit tiny.\n\n## Contributors\n\n-   [Ayfri](https://github.com/Ayfri)\n-

They were originally written for Android, but most of information applies to Compose for Desktop as well.\n\n### Compose for Web\n* [Getting started with Compose for Web](tutorials/Web/Getting_Started) \n* [Building web UI](tutorials/Web/Building_UI)\n* [Handling Events](tutorials/Web/Events_Handling)\n* [Controlled and Uncontrolled inputs](tutorials/Web/Controlled_Uncontrolled_Inputs)\n* [Style DSL](tutorials/Web/Style_Dsl)\n* [Using test-utils](tutorials/Web/Using_Test_Utils)\n\n### Jetpack Compose for Android\nCompose Multiplatform uses Jetpack Compose developed by Google when you target Android platform. See more info about it [here](tutorials/Development_for_Android).\n\n[The docs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) published by Google are great and decribe how to develop on Compose for Android.\n\nNote that when you use Compose Multiplatform, you setup your project differently. You can create a multiplatform project with Android support via IDEA Project Wizard, or by copying [multiplatform template](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/templates/multiplatform-template). In `androidMain` source set you can use almost all information from the docs, and in `commonMain` source set you can use information from Foundation and Design sections.\n\n## Examples\n   * [codeviewer](examples/codeviewer) - File Browser and Code Viewer application for Android and Desktop\n   * [imageviewer](examples/imageviewer) - Image Viewer application for Android and Desktop\n   * [issues](examples/issues) - GitHub issue tracker with an adaptive UI and ktor-client\n   * [game](examples/falling-balls) - Simple game\n   * [game](experimental/examples/falling-balls-mpp) - Simple game for web target\n   * [compose-bird](examples/web-compose-bird) - A flappy bird clone using Compose for Web\n   * [notepad](examples/notepad) - Notepad, using the new experimental Composable Window API\n   * [todoapp](examples/todoapp) - TODO items tracker with persistence and multiple screens\n   * [todoapp-lite](examples/todoapp-lite) - A simplified version of [todoapp](examples/todoapp), fully based on Compose\n   * [widgets gallery](examples/widgets-gallery) - Gallery of standard widgets\n   * [IDEA plugin](examples/intellij-plugin) - Plugin for IDEA using Compose for Desktop\n\n## Other ##\n* [artwork](artwork) - design artifacts\n* [benchmarks](benchmarks) - collection of benchmarks\n* [compose](compose) - composite build of [Compose-jb sources](https://github.com/JetBrains/androidx)\n* [ci](ci) - Continuous Integration helpers\n* [gradle-plugins](gradle-plugins) - a plugin, simplifying usage of Compose Multiplatform with Gradle\n* [templates](templates) - new application templates\n* [components](components) - custom components of Compose Multiplatform\n   * [Split Pane](components/SplitPane)\n* [experimental](experimental) - experimental components and examples\n   * [cef](experimental/cef) - CEF integration in Jetpack Compose (somewhat outdated)\n   * [Video Player](experimental/components/VideoPlayer)\n   * [LWJGL integration](experimental/lwjgl-integration) - An example showing how to integrate Compose with [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org)\n   * [CLI example](experimental/build_from_cli) - An example showing how to build Compose without Gradle\n       \n## Getting latest version of Compose Multiplatform ##\n\nSee https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/releases/latest for the latest stable release or https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/releases for all stable and dev releases.\n","size":142539,"stargazersCount":0,"topics":[],"updatedAt":"2022-08-04T13:35:52Z","visibility":"public","watchersCount":0},{"archived":false,"commitsCount":1260,"contributorsCount":461,"createdAt":"2021-01-04T18:29:29Z","defaultBranch":"main","description":"deno.land website ","fork":true,"forksCount":1,"fullName":"Ayfri/deno_website2_fr","homepage":"https://deno.land","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/Ayfri/deno_website2_fr","id":326773565,"isTemplate":false,"language":"TypeScript","name":"deno_website2_fr","openIssuesCount":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushedAt":"2021-04-19T06:49:35Z","readmeContent":"# deno_website2_fr\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/denoland/deno_website2/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/denoland/deno_website2/actions)\n\nCeci est le code pour https://deno.land/\n\nCe site Web se compose de deux parties\n\n1.

We do, however expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript before attempting to write bots. Discord.js \\(and other discord libraries\\) require some median-to-advanced concepts that might be hard to grasp for anyone that doesn't have a good footing with the language.\n\n## Get Support\n\nIf you have any questions after reading this guide, please don't hesitate to join us on our Discord server, \"An Idiot's Guide\".

release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pronote-api?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/pronote-api)\n\nAPI Pronote **2020/2021** complète et plutôt stable avec intégration de nombreux CAS (connexion avec comptes spéciaux pour les régions).\n\nDisponible en tant que :\n- Librairie Node.JS [via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pronote-api) (note : **support TypeScript** complet)\n- Serveur GraphQL (donc depuis **n'importe que langage**), [voir instructions](#serveur-graphql)\n\n**Nouveauté 2020/2021 : [Session conservable](#conserver-la-session)**\n\n## Données récupérables\n\n- Infos Pronote, établissement et utilisateur\n- Emploi du temps\n- Devoirs\n- Notes\n- Compétences/évaluations\n- Absences/punitions/retenues\n- Informations\n- Menu de la cantine\n\nÀ chaque fois, il est possible de choisir quelle période voire quel intervalle de jours récupérer précisément.\n\n## Comptes région supportés\n\n**Uniquement dans le cas où vous ne pouvez PAS vous connecter directement par Pronote, mais devez passer par une interface régionale spéciale**\n\n**Si vous pouvez vous connecter directement sur l'interface de Pronote, l'API devrait fonctionner PEU IMPORTE VOTRE ACADÉMIE**\n\nSinon, l'API propose de se connecter à Pronote avec des comptes des académies suivantes :\n\n- Académie de Lyon (CAS : `ac-lyon`)\n- Académie de Montpellier (CAS : `ac-montpellier`)\n- Académie de Toulouse (CAS : `ac-toulouse`)\n- Académie de Grenoble (CAS : `ac-grenoble`)\n- Académie de Rouen (CAS : `ac-rouen`)\n- Académie de Rouen (Arsene76) (CAS : `arsene76`)\n- Académie de Lille

`laclasse`)\n\n## Utilisation\n\n### Librairie\n\n```\n$ npm i --save pronote-api\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst pronote = require('pronote-api');\n\n// Exemple\nconst url = 'https://demo.index-education.net/pronote/';\nconst username = 'demonstration';\nconst password = 'pronotevs';\n\nasync function main()\n{\n    const session = await pronote.login(url, username, password/*, cas*/);\n    \n    console.log(session.user.name); // Affiche le nom de l'élève\n    console.log(session.user.studentClass.name); // Affiche la classe de l'élève\n    \n    const timetable = await session.timetable(); // Récupérer l'emploi du temps d'aujourd'hui\n    const marks = await session.marks(); // Récupérer les notes du trimestre\n    \n    console.log(`L'élève a ${timetable.length} cours aujourd'hui`); \n    console.log(`et a pour l'instant une moyenne de ${marks.averages.student} ce trimestre.`);\n    \n    // etc. les fonctions utilisables sont 'timetable', 'marks', 'contents', 'evaluations', 'absences',\n    // 'infos', et 'menu', sans oublier les champs 'user' et 'params' qui regorgent d'informations.\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n    if (err.code === pronote.errors.WRONG_CREDENTIALS.code) {\n        console.error('Mauvais identifiants');    \n    } else {\n        console.error(err);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport { login } from 'pronote-api';\n\nasync function main()\n{\n    const session = await login(url, username, password/*, cas*/);\n    // ... Voir l'exemple JavaScript\n}\n```\n\n### Serveur GraphQL\n\n```\n$ npm i -g pronote-api\n$ pronote-api-server\n```\n\n**Note : Toutes les requêtes nécessitent la présence du header `Content-Type: application/json`**\n\nPour commencer, il faut se connecter avec une requête `POST` sur `/auth/login` contenant :\n```json\n{\n    \"url\": \"URL de l'instance Pronote\",\n    \"username\": \"Nom d'utilisateur\",\n    \"password\": \"Mot de passe\",\n    \"cas\": \"CAS (facultatif)\"\n}\n```\n\nLe serveur renverra alors une réponse de cette forme :\n```json\n{\n    \"token\": \"UN TOKEN DE SESSION\"  \n}\n```\n\nRetenez le Token, et vous pourrez appeler `POST /auth/logout` et `POST /graphql` **avec en Header `Token: LETOKEN`**,\npour cette dernière le contenu doit être un JSON avec un field `query` contenant votre requête GraphQL.\n\nExemple, pour récupérer les salles des cours du Mercredi 2 Septembre :\n```graphql\n{\n    timetable(from: \"2020-09-02\") {\n        room   \n    }\n}\n```\n\nLe schéma complet des requêtes et mutations se trouve [à cet endroit](https://github.com/Litarvan/pronote-api/blob/master/src/server/schema.graphql) \n\n### Au secours je n'arrive pas à m'y connecter\n\nPar défaut le serveur est ouvert sur `127.0.0.1`, vous ne pouvez donc vous y connecter que depuis la même machine\net avec cette adresse. Pour le lancer le serveur sur une autre adresse ou un autre port, utilisez\n`pronote-api-server PORT HOST`\n\n**ATTENTION : Il n'est pas prévu et probablement peu sécurisé d'ouvrir le serveur sur l'extérieur**\n\n## Conserver la session\n\nUne des nouvelles fonctionnalités de l'API est le fait de pouvoir garder la session envie indéfiniment.\nIl suffit pour ça d'utiliser la fonction `session.setKeepAlive(true);` (ou la mutation `mutation { setKeepAlive(enabled: true) }`).\n\n**ATTENTION : Les sessions dureront à l'infini tant que `session.setKeepAlive(false);` ne sera pas appelé ou le programme arrêté\n(dans le cas du serveur, `mutation { setKeepAlive(enabled: false) }` appelé, `/auth/logout` exécuté ou le serveur arrêté).**\n\n## API bas niveau\n\nIl est très possible que quelque chose dont vous ayez besoin ne soit pas renvoyé par l'API, pas de panique. L'API bas\nniveau permet d'accéder à tout : Les fonctions 'fetch' exportées (fetchHomeworks, fetchTimetable, etc.) permettent\nde récupérer la réponse complète de Pronote simplement traduite sans traitement supplémentaire.\n\nSi jamais une requête dont vous avez besoin n'est pas exportée, vous pouvez utiliser la fonction 'request' qui permet\nde faire facilement une requête à Pronote. Et si vous voulez outrepasser/modifier la partie authentification, vous\npouvez manuellement créer une session.\n","size":448,"stargazersCount":0,"topics":[],"updatedAt":"2020-09-19T15:40:50Z","visibility":"public","watchersCount":0},{"archived":false,"commitsCount":1,"contributorsCount":0,"createdAt":"2020-10-14T12:10:38Z","defaultBranch":"main","description":"A

To onboard a proposal that lives outside the TC39 organization:\n\n1. Transfer your repository to the [@tc39-transfer](http://github.com/tc39-transfer) organization\n  - if you are a TC39 delegate, but not a member of that organization, please contact [@LJHarb](https://github.com/ljharb)\n2. One of the chairs ([@bterlson](https://github.com/bterlson), [@gesa](https://github.com/gesa), [@MylesBorins](https://github.com/MylesBorins), or [@robpalme](https://github.com/robpalme)) will transfer your repository to the TC39 organization the next chance they get.\n\nNote that as part of the onboarding process your repository name may be normalized. Don't worry, repo redirects will continue to work **as long as** you never create a fork, or a new repository, with the same name - although Github Pages redirects will be broken (please update your links!).\n\n[regexp-legacy]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features\n[regexp-legacy-notes]:

some, like the `eval` command, can damage your machine if anyone can use it.\nSo most of the commands are private in the bot I use.<br>\nYou can see an example of what to put into the `.env` file into the [.env.example file](./.env.example);\n\nHowever, you can still invite the bot with [this
