Forms and C#.\n\n## What is it?\n\nAyBreak is a simple breakout game made in Windows Forms and C#.\nIt has been made as a school project for Ynov in about 2 weeks.\nIt has been chosen between 6 different projects like platformer, pong, etc, and I chose to make a breakout game because I thought it would be the funniest to make and the most interesting to do.\n\n### Theme\n\nThere are no real theme in the game, but I tried to make it as simple as possible, with a simple background and a simple design.\nI created my own ball sprite and used powerups sprites from another game LBreakout HD, some are unused in the game.\n\n### Main objectives\n\n- [x] Make a breakout game\n- [x] Make a menu\n- [x] Make a score system\n- [x] Make a level system and selection screen\n- [x] Have a level system working with a file\n- [x] Make a pause menu\n- [x] Make a lives system\n- [x] Make a powerups system\n- [ ] Make a settings menu\n- [ ] Have perfect collisions\n- [ ] Make a level editor\n- [ ] Have different themes\n\n### Difficulties encountered\n\nThe main difficulty encountered was the collision detection.\nIt was hard to make it work with the ball and the bricks.\nIt is currently not perfect, but it works most of the time, and it's not a big problem while playing.\n\nThe second main difficulty was to polish the game while still having the problems of Windows Forms (like the flickering or the lack of transparency).\nIt was fixed by not using a lot of sprites (just colored rectangles) and by having a simple black background.\n\n## How to play\n\nUse the arrow keys to move the paddle and hit the ball. The ball will bounce off the paddle and the bricks. The game ends when the there are no more bricks.\nIf the ball hits the bottom of the screen, you lose a life. You have 5 lives.\nYou can spawn random powerups by breaking bricks.\nThe powerups are:\n- Ball no-clip\n- Ball speed up\n- Ball speed down\n- Increase paddle size\n- More ball\n- More life\n- Score add\n- Random\n\n### Controls\n\n- Left arrow key: Move paddle left\n- Right arrow key: Move paddle right\n- Mouse: Move paddle\n- Space: Launch balls\n- R: Restart balls\n- Escape: Pause game\n- B: Accelerate balls\n\n## How to build\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or Rider\n3. Build the solution using the build button\n4. Run the game using the run button\n\n### Debug specificities\n\nWhen the game is run in debug mode, you will start with 2 balls and a label will be shown for each brick, showing their health.\n","size":261,"stargazers_count":3,"topics":["breakout","csharp","windows-forms"],"updated_at":"2024-02-16T15:34:22Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":63,"contributors_count":2,"created_at":"2020-07-23T14:44:52Z","default_branch":"master","description":"Informations

Basic CommandHandler\n\nThis is a simple Command Handler using `module.exports` for a configuration, run function and help module for a help command auto-generated.\n\nI'd advice you to know JavaScript and Node.js before using it.<br>\nYou'll understand that this Command Handler is very basic and for a big projet you should probably use a better one.<br>\nI can recommend you the other one I've made : [Advanced Command Handler](https://github.com/Advanced-Command-Handler/Advanced-Command-Handler).\n\n## How to use it\n\nSimply clone this repo.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Ayfri/Basic-CommandHandler\n```\nSet the [configuration](#Configuration) and you're ready to go.\n\nIf you want to use Discord.js v12, use this command instead.\n```bash\ngit clone -b v12 https://github.com/Ayfri/Basic-CommandHandler\n```\nIt will clone the `v12` branch of this repo.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo start the bot you have to start with NodeJS the `main.js` file. If you want the bot to be sharded, start with le `index.js` file. There is a configuration file, `informations/config.json`.\nIn `owners` you have to add your ID (in a String).\n\n## Templates\n\n### Command\n\n```js\nmodule.exports.run = async (client, message, args) => {\n\t// Code goes here.\n};\n\nmodule.exports.config = {\n\tcategory: '',\n\tname: __filename.slice(__dirname.length + 1, __filename.length - 3),\n\taliases: [],\n\tserverForced: false,\n};\n\nmodule.exports.help = {\n\tdescription: '',\n\tsyntax: ``,\n\texamples: ``,\n};\n```\n\nThe name of the command is the name of the file. All the props in the modules are required.\n\n### Event\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = async (client, event, args) => {\n\t// Code goes here.\n};\n```\n\n## Features\n\nThere are already managed categories :\n\n-   not-ready : Like owner category.\n-   owner : Owners only (configuration).\n-   administration : Only users that have the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission.\n-   moderation : Only users that have the `KICK_MEMBERS` permission.\n\nThe `client` object has added methods and props like :\n\n| Field name                  | Description                          |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| commands                    | Enmap Object.                        |\n| writeFile( Path, JSObject ) | Safely save your JSObject in a JSON. |\n","size":179,"stargazers_count":2,"topics":["bot","command-handler","discord-js"],"updated_at":"2023-02-16T09:25:28Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":2},{"archived":false,"commits_count":18,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2021-07-27T16:54:19Z","default_branch":"master","description":"A package for using better lists.","fork":false,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/Better-Lists","homepage":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/Better-Lists","id":390060991,"is_template":false,"language":"TypeScript","name":"Better-Lists","open_issues_count":0,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2021-08-01T18:10:01Z","readme_content":"# Better-List\n\n[![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/better-list)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-list)<br>\n[![npm install](https://nodei.co/npm/better-list.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-list)<br>\nA package for using better lists.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install it, simply run this command :\n\n```bash\nnpm install better-list --save\n```\n\n## What it contains\n\nThis package contains all the methods that the Kotlin `MutableList`s contains with proper typings in a `List` class.\n\nIt may contains other useful classes and functions later if people ask for it.\n","size":15,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2021-08-01T18:10:04Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":26,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2021-01-19T23:51:01Z","default_branch":"master","description":"A little fun bot that I made.

Cat'aclysm: Claw of the Dead\n\nA Tower Defense game in zombie apocalypse theme.\nYou play with cats, and you have to defend your city from the zombie invasion using towers.\n\n## Engine\n\nThe game is made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) 4.0.2.\n\n## GitHub\n\n#### Commit :\n\n**type(scope): subject**\n\n* **type**: type of commit\n* **scope**: the scope that is affected by this commit 1 to 2 word, can contain space\n* **subject**: a short description of the commit, around 20 words max, can contain capitalization or not\n\n#### Types :\n\n* `ci` : Change of files and scripts related to continuous integration\n* `chore` : Change of the build system or development tools\n* `feat` : New feature\n* `fix` : Bug fix\n* `perf` : Optimization of the code to improve performance\n* `refactor` : Modification of the code without changing functionality\n* `style` : Change to the code style\n* `tweak` : Small change to the code that doesn't change the functionality\n\n#### Examples :\n\n```\nfeat(zombies): Add new pigeon zombie.\n```\n\n```\nfix(tower gui): fix tower name not being displayed correctly\n```\n\n```\nrefactor(animations): use animation player instead of animation tree for zombies\n```\n\n## Project Files :\n\nWe are following the Godot conventions as presented [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/best_practices/index.html).\nUse the built-in editor from Godot to code or use any JetBrains IDE to edit godot scripts but do not use any other IDE.\n\n### Code Architecture :\n\n```\n/.gitignore\n/project.godot\n/assets/fonts/**.ttf : fonts\n/assets/localization/**.po : localization files\n/assets/scripts/**.gd : scripts\n/assets/musics/**.mp3 : musics\n/assets/sounds/**.ogg : sounds\n/assets/sprites/particles/**.png :

scenes\n```\n\n### Code Style :\n\n* Everything is in english\n* Use `snake_case` for files\n* Use `PascalCase` for nodes\n* Use `snake_case` for variables, constants, functions and signals\n* Use `PascalCase` for classes, enums and autoloads\n* Name every node with its function on the parent node (or the object name if root)\n* Type everything unless it's obvious (e.g. `var x: int = 1` is fine, but `var x := 1` is simpler)\n* Have all safe lines everywhere possible without creating too many variables (ex: if you need to access a node once, don't create a variable just for that)\n* Cast every node to their types, ex : `var player := $Player as Area2D;`\n* Keep lines relatively short (140 characters max)\n* Use tabs for indentation\n* Use `;` for every line\n\n## Exporting\n\nThe game is exported for the Windows platform on every release, other platforms may come later.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE)

Cette documentation présente la mise en\nplace de l'architecture réseau que nous avons réalisé dans le cadre de ce projet. <br><br>\nCe projet consiste à mettre en place une architecture réseau pour une entreprise lambda. Cette architecture doit\npermettre de répondre aux besoins de l'entreprise, à savoir : avoir une sécurité de son réseau via un parefeu, que ses\ncollaborateurs puissent s’authentifier et ouvrir leur propre session, qu’ils puissent envoyer des mails en\ninterne dans un premier temps, et accéder à un intranet.\n\n### Objectifs\n\nLes objectifs de ce projet étaient les suivants :\n\n- Configurer et administrer un serveur\n- Gérer un environnement virtuel\n- Mettre en place une infrastructure système et réseaux\n- Appréhender la sécurité\n\n### Réalisations\n\nNotre projet a consisté à :\n\n- Configurer un pare-feu PFSense\n- Configurer un Active Directory pour gérer les utilisateurs\n- Configurer un serveur de messagerie interne\n- Configurer un serveur web pour l'intranet\n- Respecter les règles de sécurité afin de protéger le réseau (cloisonnement des réseaux, etc.)\n\n## Présentation de l'architecture réseau\n\n### Schéma de l'architecture\n\n![Schéma de l'architecture](schema.png)\n\n### Tableau d'adressage\n\n|                          | Lan 0/Admin | Lan 1/AD    | Lan 2/Web-Mail | Lan 3/Clients |\n|:-------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Sous réseau              | 10.0.0.0/24 | 10.0.1.0/24 | 10.0.2.0/24    | 10.0.3.0/24   |\n| Passerelle/Interface LAN | 10.0.0.1    | 10.0.1.1    | 10.0.2.1       | 10.0.3.1      |\n| Serveur                  |             | 10.0.1.x    | 10.0.2.x       |               |\n| Client                   | 10.0.0.x    |             |                | 10.0.3.x      |\n\n### Explication de l'architecture\n\nL'architecture réseau est composée de 4 LANs, un pour l'administration, un pour l'Active Directory, un pour le serveur\nweb ainsi que la messagerie (DMZ) et un pour les clients. Chaque LAN est cloisonné par un pare-feu PFSense.\n\n- `Lan 0/Admin` : Ce LAN est réservé à l'administration du réseau, il est donc accessible uniquement par les\n  administrateurs.\n- `Lan 1/AD` : Ce LAN est réservé à l'Active Directory, il est donc accessible uniquement par les administrateurs et les\n  utilisateurs du domaine.\n- `Lan 2/Web-Mail (DMZ)` : Ce LAN est réservé au serveur web et à la messagerie, il est donc accessible uniquement par\n  les administrateurs et les utilisateurs du domaine.\n- `Lan 3/Clients` : Ce LAN est réservé aux clients, il est donc accessible uniquement par les administrateurs et les\n  utilisateurs du domaine.\n\n## Mise en place de la solution\n\n### PFSense\n\n#### Installation\n\nPFSense est un outil de surveillance de la sécurité du réseau. Il permet de surveiller les connexions et les\ndéconnexions des utilisateurs.<br>\nPour l'installer, il suffit de télécharger un ISO sur le site de la communauté de PFSense, puis de l'installer sur le\nserveur.\n\n![PFSense Installation Étape 2](pfsense-install-2.png)\n\nL'installation ne requiert pas d'autres étapes, une fois lancée PFSense est prêt à être utilisé.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nUne fois PFSense installé, il faut le configurer.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 1](pfsense-config-1.png)\n\nUne fois le copyright accepté, un menu d'installation est disponible.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 2](pfsense-config-2.png)\n\nPFSense demande de choisir un clavier et un groupe de raccourcis à utiliser, nous utilisons celui de base.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 3](pfsense-config-3.png)\n\nConfiguration des partitions du disque dur.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 4](pfsense-config-4.png)\n\nValidation de la configuration à installer.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 5](pfsense-config-5.png)\n\nPFSense demande de choisir un type d'utilisation de disque dur à plusieurs partitions, nous utilisons le type de disque\ndur par défaut.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 6](pfsense-config-6.png)\n\nValidation de la configuration du disque dur.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 7](pfsense-config-7.png)\n\nLa machine demande de formater les partitions, il faut appuyer sur * pour les sélectionner toutes.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 8](pfsense-config-8.png)\n\nPFSense s'installe après le formatage des partitions.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 9](pfsense-config-9.png)\n\nUne fois l'installation terminée, PFSense nous propose d'ouvrir un terminal pour finaliser notre installation.<br>\nLe projet n'a pas besoin d'autre configuration.\n\n![Configuration pfsense 10](pfsense-config-10.png)\n\nPFSense est maintenant configuré et averti qu'il va redémarrer.\n\n#### Configuration du réseau\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 1](pfsense-network-1.png)\n\nLe terminal de PFSense, nous allons définir les adresses IP des différents LANs en choisissant l'option 2.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 1.1](pfsense-network1.1.png)\n\nPour l'exemple, nous allons configurer le LAN 0/Admin. Dans notre configuration, le LAN 0/Admin est sur l'interface 4.\n<br>Il faut donc ensuite définit l'adresse IP de l'interface 4 ainsi que le masque de sous-réseau.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 1.2](pfsense-network1.2.png)\n\nChoix des options pour ne pas mettre de DHCP et de ne pas utiliser IPv6 et d'autres options.<br>\nPuis nous ferons la même chose pour les autres LANs.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 1.3](pfsense-network1.3.png)\n\nVoilà ce que donne la configuration des interfaces.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 2](pfsense-network-2.png)\n\nUne fois les interfaces configurées, PFSense créé un site local via son adresse IP pour pouvoir configurer des\nrègles.<br>\nIl faut se connecter au site pour pouvoir configurer les règles (par défaut le nom de compte est admin et le mot de\npasse est pfsense).\n\n> Note :\n> Le pare-feu va bloquer le rafraîchissement de notre page donc taper la commande `pfctl -d` dans le terminal du\n> PfSense,\n> qui va désactiver le pare-feu pour nous permettre d’affecter nos changements.<br>\n> ![Configuration du réseau pfsense 3](pfsense-network-3.png)\n\n#### Configuration du DHCP\n\nNotre serveur DHCP est le serveur PFSense, il faut donc le configurer pour qu'il puisse attribuer des adresses IP aux\nclients. <br>\n\nPour cela, il faut aller dans l'onglet `Services` puis `DHCP Server`. Ensuite, on choisit sur quel LAN on veut\nconfigurer le serveur DHCP. <br>\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 4](pfsense-dhcp-1.png)\n\nAprès avoir choisi le LAN, il faut activer le serveur DHCP en cochant la\ncase `Enable DHCP server on LAN interface`. <br>\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 4](pfsense-dhcp-2.png)\n\nEnsuite, il faut configurer le serveur DHCP en choisissant une plage d'adresses IP à attribuer aux clients. <br>\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 4](pfsense-dhcp-3.png)\n\nOn choisit ensuite le serveur DNS à utiliser, dans notre cas, nous utilisons le serveur DNS de notre Active Directory.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 4](pfsense-dhcp-4.png)\n\nEnfin, on configure la passerelle par défaut, dans notre cas, nous utilisons l'adresse IP de notre serveur PFSense\n\n#### Configuration des règles du pare-feu\n\nConcernant les règles de pare-feu, nous allons paramétrer les règles de base pour chaque LAN. <br>\nPour cela, il faut aller dans l'onglet `Firewall` puis `Rules`. Ensuite, on choisit sur quel LAN on veut configurer les\nrègles.\n\n![Configuration du réseau pfsense 4](pfsense-network-4.png)\n\nUne fois la LAN choisie, on clique sur `Add` pour ajouter une règle.\n\nDans notre cas la règle la plus importante est celle qui permet de bloquer les connexions venant du WAN vers le LAN du\nserveur web et mail. En effet, comme il s'agit d'un intranet, nous ne voulons pas que des personnes extérieures puissent\naccéder à ces services.\n\nConcernant les autres règles, cela dépend les besoins de chaque entreprise. Par exemple, une entreprise manipulant des\ndonnées sensibles peut vouloir bloquer l'accès à certains sites internet voir bloquer l'accès à internet tout court.\nMais si l'entreprise souhaite que ses employés puissent accéder à internet, elle peut vouloir bloquer l'accès à certains\nsites internet comme les réseaux sociaux ou les sites de streaming. <br>\n\n#### Configuration de la sauvegarde\n\nNous allons maintenant configurer la sauvegarde automatique de la configuration de PFSense.\n\n![Configuration de la sauvegarde 1](pfsense-backup-1.png)\n\nPour cela, il faut aller dans l'onglet `Services` puis `Auto Config Backup`.\n\n![Configuration de la sauvegarde 2](pfsense-backup-2.png)\n\nIl faut ensuite activer la sauvegarde automatique en cliquant sur `Enable` puis en choisissant la fréquence de\nsauvegarde. <br>\nDans notre cas, nous allons activer la sauvegarde automatique lors de chaque modification de la configuration.\n\n![Configuration de la sauvegarde 3](pfsense-backup-3.png)\n\nAinsi lors de chaque modification de la configuration, PFSense va sauvegarder la configuration dans un fichier XML. La\nliste des sauvegardes est disponible dans l'onglet `Restore`. <br>\nSi nous voulons restaurer une sauvegarde, il suffit de cliquer sur l'image de restauration de la sauvegarde voulue.\n\n![Configuration de la sauvegarde 4](pfsense-backup-4.png)\n\nPFSense nous demande ensuite si nous voulons restaurer la sauvegarde, il faut cliquer sur `OK`.\n\nLa restauration de la sauvegarde de la configuration est maintenant terminée.\n\n### Active Directory\n\n#### Installation\n\nPlusieurs bonnes pratiques sont à respecter lors de l'installation d'un serveur Windows Server 2019 :\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 1](windows-server-config-1.png)\n\nD'abord, nous changeons le nom de la machine pour qu'il soit plus facile à identifier.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 2](windows-server-config-2.png)\n\nNous changeons l'adresse IP de la machine pour qu'elle soit dans le même réseau que le serveur PFSense.<br>\nPuis, nous installons aussi les mises à jour de Windows Server 2019.\n\n#### Configuration\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 3](windows-server-config-3.png)\n\nMaintenant que le serveur est prêt, nous pouvons installer le rôle Active Directory.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 4](windows-server-config-4.png)\n\nNous choisissons d'installer de nouveaux rôles sur le serveur.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 5](windows-server-config-5.png)\n\nNous choisissons le rôle Active Directory et nous choisissons le serveur sur lequel l'installer.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 6](windows-server-config-6.png)\n\nNous choisissons les options par défaut et vérifions que tout est correct.<br>\nL'installation du rôle Active Directory est maintenant terminée.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 7](windows-server-config-7.png)\n\nNous pouvons maintenant déployer le serveur en tant que contrôleur de domaine.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 8](windows-server-config-8.png)\n\nNous choisissons de créer un nouveau domaine dans une nouvelle forêt.<br>\nLe nom de domaine sera `infra.com` pour le projet.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 9](windows-server-config-9.png)\n\nNous choisissons le niveau fonctionnel de la forêt et du domaine et nous choisissons le mot de passe du mode de restauration des services d'annuaire.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 10](windows-server-config-10.png)\n\nNous choisissons les options par défaut jusqu'à la fin de l'installation et nous vérifions que tout est correct.\n\n#### Configuration des utilisateurs\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 11](windows-server-config-11.png)\n\nNous pouvons maintenant créer des utilisateurs pour le domaine en allant dans l'onglet `Utilisateurs et ordinateurs Active Directory`.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 12](windows-server-config-12.png)\n\nNous créons les Unités d'Organisation Admin et Client pour les utilisateurs et les groupes.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 13](windows-server-config-13.png)\n![Configuration du Windows Server 14](windows-server-config-14.png)\n\nExemple de création d'un utilisateur dans l'Unité d'Organisation Admin.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Server 15](windows-server-config-15.png)\n\nPuis, nous ajoutons l'utilisateur dans le groupe Administrateurs.\n\n#### Configuration du DNS\n\nNous allons maintenant configurer le DNS sur le serveur Windows Server 2019.<br>\nLe serveur DNS va permettre de faire la résolution de nom de domaine.<br>\nUne zone de recherche directe est déjà créée par défaut pour le domaine `infra.com`.\n\n![Configuration du DNS 1](windows-server-dns-1.png)\n\nNous allons ajouter une zone de recherche inversée pour le domaine `infra.com`.\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 2]&#40;windows-server-dns-2.png&#41;)\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 3]&#40;windows-server-dns-3.png&#41;)\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 4]&#40;windows-server-dns-4.png&#41;)\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 5]&#40;windows-server-dns-5.png&#41;)\n![Configuration du DNS 6](windows-server-dns-6.png)\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 7]&#40;windows-server-dns-7.png&#41;)\n\nConcernant les options à choisir, on laisse les options par défaut sauf dans le nom de la zone de recherche inversée où on indique le début de l'adresse IP du serveur Windows\nServer 2019.\nAinsi, la zone de recherche inversée sera `10.0`.<br>\nOn fait ceci pour que le serveur DNS puisse faire la résolution de nom de domaine et de toutes les adresses IP du réseau.\n\n[//]: # (![Configuration du DNS 8]&#40;windows-server-dns-8.png&#41;)\n\n[//]: # ()\n\n[//]: # (Nous créons un nouveau pointeur pour la zone de recherche inversée.)\n\n![Configuration du DNS 9](windows-server-dns-9.png)\n\nOn utilise la commande `nslookup` pour vérifier que la résolution de nom de domaine fonctionne bien. On vérifie aussi que la résolution de nom de domaine inverse fonctionne bien.\n\nNotre serveur DNS est maintenant configuré.\n\n### Serveur de messagerie\n\nPour le service de messagerie, nous allons utiliser le service de messagerie de Windows Exchange Server 2019.<br>\nNous allons installer le service de messagerie un nouveau serveur Windows Server 2019. <br>\nNous passerons donc les détails de l'installation du windows serveur ainsi que des bonnes pratiques à respecter lors de l'installation, car nous l'avons déjà fait précédemment.\n\n#### Installation\n\nPour commencer, il faudra télécharger l'image ISO de Windows Exchange Server 2019 sur le site de Microsoft.<br>\nUne fois l'image ISO téléchargée, nous pouvons lancer l'installation de Windows Exchange Server 2019.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 1](exchange-1.png)\n\nOn laisse les options par défaut pour la plupart des options, dans la partie \"Sélection du rôle serveur\" on choisit\n`Rôle de boîte aux lettres`.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 2](exchange-2.png)\n\nOn continue alors jusqu'à demander le nom de l'organisation. On choisit `infra.com` pour le nom de l'organisation dans\nnotre cas. <br>\nAprès cela, on continue jusqu'à la fin des configurations. <br>\nSe lancera ensuite l'installation de Windows Exchange Server 2019 qui peut être excessivement longue. Une fois\nl'installation terminée, on redémarre le serveur.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nAvant de configurer le serveur de messagerie, on va retourner dans l'Active Directory pour créer un nouvel utilisateur qui sera le compte administrateur du serveur de messagerie.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 3](exchange-3.png)\n\nPar ailleurs, on se rend compte en retournant dans l'AD qu'une nouvelle Unité d'Organisation a été créée pour le serveur de messagerie.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 4](exchange-4.png)\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 5](exchange-5.png)\n\nAfin de clarifier les choses, nous allons créer une Unité d'Organisation `Exchange` dans laquelle nous allons mettre le ou les comptes administrateurs du serveur de messagerie.\nIl ne faut donc pas oublier de lui associer les droits d'administrateur du serveur de messagerie.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 6](exchange-6.png)\n\nMaintenant que le compte administrateur est créé, nous pouvons nous connecter au serveur de messagerie avec ce compte. <br>\nPour cela, nous allons entrer l'URL `https://localhost/ecp` dans un navigateur web. <br>\nCela nous permettra de nous connecter à l'interface d'administration du serveur de messagerie.\n\nNous allons nous connecter avec le compte administrateur que nous venons de créer.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 7](exchange-7.png)\n\nNous arrivons alors sur l'interface d'administration du serveur de messagerie. <br>\nDe là, nous allons pouvoir configurer le serveur de messagerie.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 8](exchange-8.png)\n\nDans notre cas nous allons ajouter une nouvelle boîte aux lettres pour l'utilisateur `Pace Fabio`.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 9](exchange-9.png)\n\nOn remplit alors l'alias de la boîte aux lettres, c'est-à-dire le suffixe de l'adresse mail. <br>\nEt on n'oublie pas non plus de choisir l'utilisateur auquel on veut associer la boîte aux lettres.\n\nUne fois cela fait, notre boîte aux lettres est créée et est prête à être utilisée.\n\n#### Utilisation de la messagerie\n\nPour utiliser la messagerie, nous allons utiliser nous connecter sur une machine Client Windows. <br>\nOn inscrit alors dans l'URL du navigateur web l'adresse IP du serveur de messagerie, ce qui nous permettra de nous\nconnecter à l'interface de connexion de la messagerie. <br>\nOn se connecte alors avec l'adresse mail et le mot de passe de l'utilisateur auquel on a associé la boîte aux lettres.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 10](exchange-10.png)\n\nNous voilà connecté à la messagerie sur le compte de l'utilisateur `Pace Fabio`.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 11](exchange-11.png)\n\nOn peut alors envoyer un mail à un autre utilisateur de la messagerie.\n\n![Configuration du Windows Exchange Server 12](exchange-12.png)\n\nEn se connectant sur la messagerie de l'utilisateur auquel on a envoyé le mail, on peut voir que le mail a bien été reçu.\n\nAinsi, nous avons configuré un serveur de messagerie avec Windows Exchange Server 2019 et nous avons pu envoyer et recevoir des mails sur notre domaine `infra.com`.\n\n## Serveur Web\n\nPour le serveur web, nous allons utiliser le service Nginx. <br>\nNous allons installer le service Nginx sur une nouvelle machine Ubuntu.\n\nConcernant les configurations de la machine Ubuntu, nous allons passer les détails de l'installation du système, car il n'y a rien de particulier à faire.\n\nOn commence par mettre à jour les paquets de la machine Ubuntu.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\n```\n\nOn installe ensuite le service Nginx.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install nginx\n```\n\nUne fois l'installation terminée, on peut vérifier que le service Nginx est bien installé et qu'il fonctionne.\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status nginx\n```\n\nUne fois le service Nginx installé, on peut se connecter à l'adresse IP de la machine Ubuntu avec un navigateur web. <br>\nAinsi, on peut voir que le service Nginx est bien installé et qu'il fonctionne.\n\nIl reste maintenant à personnaliser la page d'accueil du serveur web afin qu'elle corresponde à notre domaine `infra.com`. <br>\nÉtant donné que dans notre cas, il s'agit d'un projet de test, nous laisserons la page d'accueil par défaut de Nginx.\n\nAinsi, nous avons configuré un serveur web avec Nginx sur une machine Ubuntu. <br>\nCe dernier est accessible depuis les autres machines du réseau local via l'adresse IP de la machine Ubuntu.\n\n### Client Windows\n\nNous allons maintenant configurer le client Windows pour qu'il puisse rejoindre le domaine `infra.com`.\n\n> Important ! <br>\n> La version de windows utilisée ne doit pas être une version familiale, car ces dernières ne permettent pas de\n> rejoindre\n> un domaine.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nPour commencer, nous allons configurer le client Windows pour qu'il puisse rejoindre le domaine `infra.com`.\n\n![Configuration du DNS 10](windows-client-config-200.png)\n![Configuration du DNS 11](windows-client-config-201.png)\n\nPour cela, on se rend dans les paramètres de la machine Windows, puis dans les paramètres avancés pour pouvoir changer le nom de la machine. <br>\nOn a alors sur le bas de la fenêtre la possibilité de rejoindre un domaine. <br>\nDans notre cas, nous allons renseigner le nom de domaine `infra.com` et nous allons cliquer sur le bouton `OK`.\n\n![Configuration du DNS 12](windows-client-config-202.png)\n\nOn nous demande alors de nous connecter avec un compte administrateur du domaine. <br>\nOn se connecte alors avec le compte administrateur du domaine `infra.com`.\n\n![Configuration du DNS 13](windows-client-config-203.png)\n\nUn message nous indique alors que la machine a bien été ajoutée au domaine `infra.com`.\n\n![Configuration du DNS 14](windows-client-config-204.png)\n![Configuration du DNS 15](windows-client-config-205.png)\n\nAu redémarrage de la machine, on peut voir que l'on peut se connecter avec un compte du domaine `infra.com`.\n\nVoilà, notre machine Windows est maintenant bien connectée au domaine `infra.com`.\n\nElle est donc maintenant prête à être utilisée et à utiliser les différents services du domaine `infra.com` comme le serveur de messagerie ou l'intranet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPour conclure ce projet, nous avons pu mettre en place un domaine `infra.com` avec un serveur DNS, un serveur DHCP, un serveur de messagerie et un intranet. <br>\n\nCe projet nous a permis de mettre en place une infrastructure réseau complète pour une petite entreprise. Nous avons appris et mis en pratique les concepts et les composants\nsuivants :\n\n- Pare-feu : avec PFSense, nous avons cloisonné les réseaux, contrôlé le trafic et assuré la sécurité des communications.\n- Active Directory : nous avons configuré un domaine pour gérer de manière centralisée les utilisateurs, leurs droits d'accès et leurs sessions.\n- Serveur de messagerie : le serveur Exchange que nous avons installé permet maintenant aux utilisateurs du domaine d'échanger des emails en interne.\n- Serveur web : l'intranet que nous avons créé permettra aux employés d'accéder à des ressources partagées sur le réseau.\n- Client Windows : la configuration des postes clients a permis aux employés de s'authentifier sur le réseau d'entreprise et d'utiliser les ressources mises en place.\n\nCe projet a été l'occasion de mettre en pratique et de consolider nos connaissances dans les domaines des réseaux, de la sécurité et de l'administration système.\nNous avons pu constater l'importance de la documentation et du respect des bonnes pratiques pour assurer le fonctionnement et la maintenance à long terme d'une infrastructure\ncomplexe.\n","size":4949,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2023-06-16T08:51:59Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":12,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2022-04-20T12:48:49Z","default_branch":"master","description":"The

Minecraft Java 1.20 and later versions, I don't think I will support older versions nor Bedrock\nEdition.<br>\nYou can still create your own fork and make it compatible with older versions.<br>\nI will accept pull requests for older versions on a separate branch.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can use the [Kore Template](https://github.com/Ayfri/Kore-Template) to start a new project with Kore.\n\nOr install the library by hand with Gradle.\n\nWith Kotlin DSL:\n\n```kotlin\nimplementation(\"io.github.ayfri.kore:kore:VERSION\")\n```\n\nWith Groovy DSL:\n\n```groovy\nimplementation 'io.github.ayfri.kore:kore:VERSION'\n```\n\nThen activate the `-Xcontext-receivers` compiler option:\n\n```kotlin\nkotlin {\n\tcompilerOptions {\n\t\tfreeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xcontext-receivers\")\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou should also use Java 21 or higher:\n\n```kotlin\nkotlin {\n\tjvmToolchain(21)\n}\n```\n\nThen create a `Main.kt` file and start writing your datapacks.\nSee the [documentation](https://github.com/Ayfri/Kore/wiki/Creating-a-Datapack) for more information.\n\n## Example\n\n```kotlin\nfun main() {\n\tval datapack = dataPack(\"test\") {\n\t\tfunction(\"display_text\") {\n\t\t\ttellraw(allPlayers(), textComponent(\"Hello World!\"))\n\t\t}\n\n\t\trecipes {\n\t\t\tcraftingShaped(\"enchanted_golden_apple\") {\n\t\t\t\tpattern(\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GGG\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GAG\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GGG\"\n\t\t\t\t)\n\n\t\t\t\tkey(\"G\", Items.GOLD_BLOCK)\n\t\t\t\tkey(\"A\", Items.APPLE)\n\n\t\t\t\tresult(Items.ENCHANTED_GOLDEN_APPLE)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfunction(\"tp_random_entity_to_entity\") {\n\t\t\tval entityName = \"test\"\n\t\t\tval entity =

Clone the repository\n2. Run `docker-compose up`\n3. Install Java 17 or higher\n\n## Scripts\n\n- Run `gradle :run --args=create` for creating the `users` collection and adding fake data\n- Run `gradle :run --args=delete` for deleting the first user with more than 70 years old\n- Run `gradle :run --args=search` for searching all users with more than 30 years old\n- Run `gradle :run --args=update` for adding all users 5 years to their age\n\n## Crud operations with Mongosh\n\n### Connecting to the database\n\nFirst, here's how to connect to the database :\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it mongo1 bash\n```\n\nReplace `mongo1` with `mongo2` or `mongo3` if you want to connect to the other nodes.\n\nThen, you can connect to the database with the following command :\n\n```bash\nmongosh --host localhost --port 27017\n```\n\nThen, here's how to do CRUD operations :\n\n### Creating\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.insertOne({name: \"John\", age: 25})\n```\n\n### Reading\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.find({age: {$gt: 30}})\n```\n\n### Updating\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.updateOne({name: \"John\"}, {$set: {age: 30}})\n```\n\nDeleting :\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.deleteOne({name: \"John\"})\n```\n\n## Differences between script and CLI CRUD operations\n\nThe main difference between the script and the CLI CRUD operations is that the script is more automated and can be run in one command, while\nthe CLI operations require you to type each command manually.\nYou can also define dynamic parameters in the script, while you can't do that in the CLI.\nThe code also let us see the performance of the operations, while the CLI doesn't.\n\n## Difficulties encountered\n\nThe main difficulty I encountered was to set up the Replica Set with Docker Compose. I had to search for examples in GitHub, the main issue\nwas to initialize the replica set with the right configuration.\nUsing environment variables as my first approach was not working, I ended up removing them and use a bash script to initialize the\nReplica Set in an aside container.\n\nAnother issue I encountered was to connect to the database with code. I first created the entire code in JavaScript, but never succeeded to\nconnect to the database. I had to rewrite everything from scratch in another language, I chose Kotlin.\n","size":64,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2024-04-15T18:28:53Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":15,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2020-11-14T18:46:55Z","default_branch":"main","description":"This is a multiplayer Monopoly game made in TypeScript.","fork":false,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/Monopoly","homepage":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/Monopoly","id":312880393,"is_template":false,"language":"HTML","name":"Monopoly","open_issues_count":0,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2020-11-18T18:40:14Z","readme_content":"# Monopoly\nThis is a multiplayer Monopoly game made in TypeScript.\n","size":22,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2020-11-18T18:40:17Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":2},{"archived":false,"commits_count":32,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2024-06-30T22:39:10Z","default_branch":"main","description":"A platformer game where AI agents learn to play through reinforcement learning.","fork":false,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/Neural-Jump","homepage":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/Neural-Jump","id":822317743,"is_template":false,"language":"Python","name":"Neural-Jump","open_issues_count":0,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2024-07-05T13:20:04Z","readme_content":"# Neural-Jump\n\nA platformer game where AI agents learn to play through reinforcement learning.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Introduction](#introduction)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Introduction\n\nSuperMarioAI is a platformer game inspired by the classic Mario games.

Redis Cluster\n\n## How to install\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Run `docker compose up -d`\n3. Run `docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' redis-node-1` to get the IP address of the first node\n4. Repeat the previous step for the other nodes\n5.\n\nRun `docker exec -it redis-node-1 redis-cli --cluster create <ip1>:6379 <ip2>:6379 <ip3>:6379 <ip4>:6379 <ip5>:6379 <ip6>:6379 --cluster-replicas 1`\n\n## Testing the cluster\n\n1. Run `docker exec -it redis-node-1 redis-cli -c` to connect to the first node\n2. Run `cluster info` to get information about the cluster\n3. Run `cluster nodes` to get information about the nodes\n\n### Trying redis\n\n1. Run `set key value` to set a key\n2. Run `get key` to get the value of the key\n3. Run `keys *` to get all the keys\n4. Run `del key` to delete a key\n5. Run `flushall` to delete all keys\n6. Run `exit` to exit the redis-cli\n\nCreate a key in one node and try to get it from another node. You will see that the key is available in all nodes.\n\n### Hashes\n\n- Run `hset user:1 name \"John Doe\"` to set a hash\n- Run `hget user:1 name` to get the value of the hash\n- Run `hgetall user:1` to get all the values of the hash\n- Run `hmset user:1 name \"John Doe\" age 30` to set multiple values in a hash\n- Run `hmget user:1 name age` to get multiple values of the hash\n- Run `hdel user:1 age` to delete a value of the hash\n\n### Lists\n\n- Run `lpush list 1 2 3 4 5` to create a list\n- Run `lrange list 0 -1` to get all the values of the list\n- Run `lpop list` to remove the first element of the list\n- Run `rpop list` to remove the last element of the list\n- Run `ltrim list 0 2` to remove all elements of the list except the first three\n\n### Sets\n\n- Run `sadd set 1 2 3 4 5` to create a set\n- Run `smembers set` to get all the values of the set\n- Run `srem set 1` to remove a value of the set\n\n### Sorted Sets\n\n- Run `zadd sorted-set 1 one 2 two 3 three 4 four 5 five` to create a sorted set\n- Run `zrange sorted-set 0 -1` to get all the values of the sorted set\n- Run `zrange sorted-set 0 -1 withscores` to get all the values of the sorted set with the scores\n- Run `zrem sorted-set one` to remove a value of the sorted set\n\n### Expiring keys\n\n- Run `set key value` to set a key\n- Run `expire key 10` to set the key to expire in 10 seconds\n- Run `ttl key` to get the time to live of the key\n  Wait 10 seconds and run `get key` to see that the key is no longer available\n- Run `setex key 10 value` to set a key with an expiration time\n\n## Using Redis in a project\n\nIn this repository, you have a `index.py` file that shows how to connect to the Redis cluster using the `redis` library.\nRun `docker compose --profile testing up -d` to start the testing environment, it will add a new container that will run the `index.py`\nfile.\nSee the logs of the container to see the output of the script using `docker logs -f python-project`.\n\n### An existing project\n\nI have this project `https://github.com/Ayfri/UF_Project_B3` which is my end of year project for my third year at Ynov.\nWe have to make BigQuery requests to get data of `GDELT` project and then use this data to make predictions.\nBut each request takes a lot of time, around 30 seconds, so I thought about using Redis to cache the results of the requests.\n\nSo in this commit : [3c8aa9](`https://github.com/Ayfri/UF_Project_B3/commit/3c8aa93d802ee9d17b844b0b6748f0f67fb5a3b5`) I added a Redis\ninstance in a Docker container and I used it to cache the results of the requests.\n\nI used the `redis` library to connect to the Redis instance and I used the `set` and `get` methods to cache the results, also using JSON\nserialization to store complex data.\n\n## Redis integration introspection\n\nRedis is great for caching and simple key-value storage thanks to its speed, scalability, and ease of use.\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Blazingly fast thanks to in-memory data storage and efficient data structures.\n- Highly scalable with sharding and replication strategies.\n- Simple data model and minimalistic commands make it easy to learn and integrate.\n- Excellent for caching to improve application performance.\n- Rich set of data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, etc.\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Data persistence requires configuration and can be challenging for high-write scenarios.\n- Limited query capabilities compared to traditional databases or data warehouses.\n- Memory usage can grow quickly with large datasets or memory-intensive data structures.\n- Not well-suited for complex relational data or join operations.\n- Limited transaction support may not meet strong consistency requirements.\n\nI actually use [Redis Stack Server](https://redis.io/insight/) in a private project for storing a large amount of complex data, and it works\nperfectly.\nIt also gives us `RedisSearch` and `RedisTimeSeries` modules that we use for more advanced data management and querying.\nBefore that, we were using local files, and that was a mess to manage and query. Redis was much faster.\n\nOne good tool present in the Redis environment is [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight/), a graphical user interface that gives Redis\nusers a powerful way to visualize and interact with their data. Redis Insight allows viewing databases, querying keys and values, and\nexecuting common Redis commands through an intuitive interface. It also integrates tightly with Redis, enabling real-time monitoring and\ncommand inspection capabilities.\n\nWhile Redis has limitations, it shines for use cases like caching, session management, real-time messaging, and scenarios needing\nhigh-performance data access with simple data structures. For more complex requirements, it's often combined with other solutions or Redis\nStack Server for enhanced data management and querying capabilities.\n","size":16,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2024-05-11T21:38:04Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":2,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2022-08-23T22:52:25Z","default_branch":"master","description":"An arcade shoot them up spaced-theme game.","fork":false,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/Shooter","homepage":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/Shooter","id":528188201,"is_template":false,"language":"Kotlin","name":"Shooter","open_issues_count":0,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2022-08-23T23:03:36Z","readme_content":"# Shooter\n\nA [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).\n\nThis project was generated with a Kotlin project template that includes Kotlin application launchers and [KTX](https://libktx.github.io/) utilities.\n\n## Gradle\n\nThis project uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.\nThe Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.\nUseful Gradle tasks and flags:\n\n- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.\n- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.\n- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.\n- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.\n- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.\n- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.\n- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.\n- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.\n- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.\n- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.\n- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds

Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Ayfri/minecraft-wiki-scrapper/Update%20versions)\n\n# VersionCraft\n\nTLDR : **VersionCraft is a website listing all versions of minecraft.**\n\nThis repo is the source of the WebSite VersionCraft, not hosted for now. It is an exhaustive list of all versions of\nminecraft, starting from pre-classic to the latest snapshots. Updated automatically every week, it is always up-to-date.\n\nIf a version is missing or some wrong information are present, please make an issue.\n\nThis project was made for a school project but will be maintained by me and maybe later published.\n\n## How information is gathered\n\nThe information is gathered from the official website of minecraft using\na [separate repo](https://github.com/Ayfri/minecraft-wiki-scrapper) that scrapes the fandom wiki. Then the information\nis parsed and cleaned, and finally the information is stored in a JSON file on GitHub. The script is re-run every week\nto update the JSON file.\n\nWhen you load the website, some JavaScript scripts will fetch the JSON file and display the information.\n\n## How to use the website\n\nGo to the website on your browser, via localhost or internet (if published, not available for now). Then select the\nversion you want to see via the dropdown list.\n\nThere you can select the snapshot or pre-release or other version of minecraft you want to see. You can download the\nversion also, a tutorial is available on the main page.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe website has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Opera. For mobile, it has been tested on Android Brave.<br>\nWe do not have exact version numbers but the browsers versions where from Q3 2021. The responsive design is imperfect,\nbut it is a good compromise, font may be a bit tiny.\n\n## Contributors\n\n-   [Ayfri](https://github.com/Ayfri)\n-

Le département de l'innovation veut améliorer l'infrastructure existante pour s'assurer qu’elle peut être évolutive, facilement déployable avec un maximum d'automatisation.\n\nPOZOS souhaite que vous construisiez un **POC** (Proof Of Concept) pour montrer comment docker peut vous aider et à quel point cette technologie est efficace. Pour ce POC, POZOS vous donnera une application et voudra que vous construisiez une infrastructure \"découple\" basée sur Docker. Actuellement, l'application s'exécute sur un seul serveur avec aucune répartition de charge et aucune haute disponibilité. Lorsque POZOS a besoin de déployer une nouvelle version, à chaque fois, une erreur se produit. En conclusion, POZOS a besoin d'agilité dans son parc logiciel.\nL'application sur laquelle vous allez travailler pour cette première partie s'appelle \" student_list \", cette application est très basique et permet à POZOS d'afficher la liste des étudiants avec leur âge.\n\nCette application a deux modules :\n- Le premier module est une API REST (avec authentification basique nécessaire) qui envoie la liste d'étudiants souhaitée en format JSON\n- Le deuxième module est une application web écrite en HTML + PHP qui permet à l'utilisateur final d'obtenir une liste d'étudiants\nVotre travail consiste à créer un conteneur pour chaque module et à les faire interagir les uns avec les autres\nLe code source de l'application peut être trouvé ici (https://github.com/takoukam/B3_Ynov_student-list.git )\n\nLes fichiers que vous devez fournir (dans votre livraison) sont Dockerfile et rapport. Les fichers Dockerfile sont actuellement vides.  \nIl est maintenant temps de vous expliquer le rôle de chaque fichier :\n-\tDockerfile : le fichier qui sera utilisé pour construire l'image API et web (des détails seront donnés)\n-\tstudent_age.json : contient le nom des étudiants et l'âge au format JSON\n-\tstudent_age.py : contient le code source de l'API en python\n-\tindex.php : page PHP où l'utilisateur final sera connecté pour interagir avec le service afin de lister les étudiants ainsi que leur l'âge. Vous devez mettre à jour la ligne suivante $url = 'http://<api_ip_or_name:port>/pozos/api/v1.0/get_student_ages'; avant d'exécuter le conteneur de site Web pour que api_ip_or_name et le port correspondent à votre déploiement. \n\n## 1.2\tConstruire et tester l’API\nCi-dessous des informations capitales nécessaires pour construire le conteneur API\n-\tImage de base\n\nPour créer une image API, vous devez utiliser \"python:2.7-stretch\"\n-\tMainteneur\n\nN'oubliez pas de préciser les informations du responsable. C’est une bonne pratique. \n-\tAjouter le code source\n\nVous devez copier le code source de l'API dans le conteneur dans le chemin racine \"/\" \n-\tPrérequis\n\nL'API utilise le moteur Flask, voici une liste du package que vous devez installer\n\n````apt-get update -y && apt-get install python-dev python3-dev libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev -y````\n\n````pip install flask==1.1.2 flask_httpauth==4.1.0 flask_simpleldap python-dotenv==0.14.0````\n\n-\tDonnées persistantes (volume)\n\nCréez un dossier de données à la racine \"`/data`\" où les données seront stockées et déclarez-le en tant que volume\nVous utiliserez ce dossier pour monter la liste des étudiants\n-\tPort API\n\nPour interagir avec cette API, exposez le port 5000\n-\tCMD\n\nLorsque le conteneur démarre, il doit exécuter student_age.py (copié à l'étape 4), il devrait donc ressembler à quelque chose comme\n`CMD [ \"python\", \"./student_age.py\" ]`\n\n-\tFaites le build de votre image \n\nNom de l’image : api \ntag: 1.0\n\n-\tRéseau\n\nCréez un réseau de type bridge appelé ``my-network``. C’est ce réseau qui sera utilisé afin de faire communiquer l’api et le web de l’application.  \n\n-\tFaites le run de votre image \n\nVérifiez que le conteneur est à l’écoute et est prêt à répondre. Lors du run de votre image, pensez bien à préciser le réseau dans lequel votre api sera déployée.  Exécutez cette commande pour vous assurer que l'API répond correctement (prenez une capture d'écran à des fins de livraison)\n\n``curl -u toto:python -X GET http://<host IP>:<API exposed port>/pozos/api/v1.0/get_student_ages``\n\nFélicitations ! Vous venez de déployer l’API (le back-end de l’application). Vous êtes maintenant prêt pour l'étape suivante qui est de déployer le web (le front-end de l’application)\n\n\n## 1.3\tConstruire et tester la page web\nAprès avoir testé votre image API, vous devez déployer le site web dans le même réseau créer précédemment ``my-network``. \n\nCi-dessous des informations nécessaires pour construire le conteneur de la page web.\n\n-\tImage de base\n\nPour créer une image web, vous devez utiliser l’image \" ``php:apache`` \"\n\n-\tMainteneur\n\nN'oubliez pas de préciser les informations du responsable. C’est une bonne pratique. \n\n-\tVariable d’environnement\n\nAfin de permettre au conteneur web de se connecter à la base de données avec les identifiants corrects vous fournirez en variable d’environnement les informations ``USERNAME`` et ``PASSWORD``. \n\n-\tVolume \n\nAfin d’éviter que l'image ``php:apache`` ne soit exécutée avec le site Web par défaut, le fichiers du site web doivent être déposés dans le répertoire ``/var/www/html``.\n-\tPort web\n\nN'oubliez pas d'exposer le port d’écoute de votre serveur web \" ``php:apache`` \"\n\n-\tFaites le build de votre image \n\nNom de l’image : web-student_list \n\ntag: 1.0\n\n-\tRéseau\n\nN’oubliez pas de place le web dans le même réseau que l’API. Il s’agit en effet du réseau de type bridge appelé ``my-network`` crée précédemment. \n\n-\tFaites le run de votre image \n\nVérifiez que le conteneur est à l’écoute et est prêt à répondre. Lors du run de votre image, pensez bien à préciser le réseau dans lequel votre api sera déployée et aussi à mapper les ports.  \n\n***Enfin, accédez à votre site Web et cliquez sur le bouton  \"List Student\"\nSi la liste des élèves apparaît, vous avez réalisé avec succès l'application POZOS ! Félicitations (faites une capture d'écran)***\n\n\n","size":26,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2024-02-08T18:27:05Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":45,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2019-11-23T15:08:25Z","default_branch":"master","description":"Repository of Doctor Moderation, a super cool moderation bot for Discord !","fork":true,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/doctor_moderation","homepage":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/doctor_moderation","id":223607548,"is_template":false,"language":null,"name":"doctor_moderation","open_issues_count":3,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2021-07-30T11:20:08Z","readme_content":"# Doctor Moderation\n\nDoctor Modération is a French bot to moderate the server [Les Laboratoires JS](https://discord.gg/3vC2XWK) on Discord.\n\n# Features\n\n- [x] Ban command\n- [x] Kick command\n- [x] Warn command\n- [ ] Delmod commmand\n- [ ] Mute command\n- [x] Mod_see command\n- [x] Ping command\n- [x] Help command\n- [ ] Clear command\n    - [ ] Specific user\n    - [ ] From users\n    - [ ] From bots\n    - [ ] Before / after\n    - [ ] Regex\n    - [ ] Include\n    - [ ] Image\n    - [ ] Embed\n    \n\n\n- [ ] Anti Spam/Flood\n- [ ] Anti SelfBot\n- [x] Server Stats\n    - [x] Member Count\n    - [x] Bot Count\n\n- [ ] Server Logs\n    - [ ] Message delete\n    - [ ] Message update\n    - [ ] Role create\n    - [ ] Role update\n    - [ ] Role delete\n    - [ ] Channel create\n    - [ ] Channel update\n    - [ ] Channel delete\n    - [ ] Invite create\n\n- [ ] Mod logs\n    - [x] Warn add\n    - [ ] Warn remove\n    - [x] Ban\n    - [x] Unban\n    - [x] Kick\n    - [ ] Mute\n    - [x] Unmute\n    - [ ] Mod_see\n    \n# How to install\n\nInstalling DoctorModeration is very easy !\n\nFirst, `git clone https://github.com/loockeeer/doctor_moderation`\n\n\nThen, create a file in `src` called `token.json` with your token in a string (`\"TOKEN\"`)\n\nYou'll need to install PostgreSQL and then to pipe `database.sql` into it.\n\nTODO : DataBase API (other repository)\n","size":164,"stargazers_count":1,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2020-08-24T22:09:15Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":19,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2021-11-24T13:01:47Z","default_branch":"master","description":"A hangman game made in go.","fork":false,"forks_count":0,"full_name":"Ayfri/hangman-classic","homepage":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri/hangman-classic","id":431486509,"is_template":false,"language":"Go","name":"hangman-classic","open_issues_count":0,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34159136?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ayfri","id":34159136,"login":"Ayfri","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU5MTM2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ayfri"},"private":false,"pushed_at":"2021-12-09T13:15:41Z","readme_content":"# hangman-classic\nA hangman game made in go.\n","size":23,"stargazers_count":1,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2021-12-09T13:15:44Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":1463,"contributors_count":359,"created_at":"2020-12-06T22:37:43Z","default_branch":"master","description":"Hello world in every computer language.

Install the dependencies (`npm install`)\n3. Create a MariaDB database and import the `dump.sql` file.\n4. Create a `.env` file in the `api` folder of the project and fill it with the following variables :\n    - DATABASE_URL: The URL of your MariaDB database.\n    - POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY: The API key of the [Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/).\n5. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project and fill it with the following variables :\n    - API_URL: The URL of the API.\n    - API_KEY: The API key of the Google Maps API (you must activate the \"Places API\" on the key).\n6. Run `prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client.\n7. Run the api with `npm run api`.\n8. Run the client with `npm run dev`.\n9. Go to `http://localhost:4321/admin/load` and wait for the 'ok' to appear to load the JSON data into the database. This step can take a few dozen seconds.\n10.

release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pronote-api?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/pronote-api)\n\nAPI Pronote **2020/2021** complète et plutôt stable avec intégration de nombreux CAS (connexion avec comptes spéciaux pour les régions).\n\nDisponible en tant que :\n- Librairie Node.JS [via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pronote-api) (note : **support TypeScript** complet)\n- Serveur GraphQL (donc depuis **n'importe que langage**), [voir instructions](#serveur-graphql)\n\n**Nouveauté 2020/2021 : [Session conservable](#conserver-la-session)**\n\n## Données récupérables\n\n- Infos Pronote, établissement et utilisateur\n- Emploi du temps\n- Devoirs\n- Notes\n- Compétences/évaluations\n- Absences/punitions/retenues\n- Informations\n- Menu de la cantine\n\nÀ chaque fois, il est possible de choisir quelle période voire quel intervalle de jours récupérer précisément.\n\n## Comptes région supportés\n\n**Uniquement dans le cas où vous ne pouvez PAS vous connecter directement par Pronote, mais devez passer par une interface régionale spéciale**\n\n**Si vous pouvez vous connecter directement sur l'interface de Pronote, l'API devrait fonctionner PEU IMPORTE VOTRE

Académie de Toulouse (CAS : `ac-toulouse`)\n- Académie de Grenoble (CAS : `ac-grenoble`)\n- Académie de Rouen (CAS : `ac-rouen`)\n- Académie de Rouen (Arsene76) (CAS : `arsene76`)\n- Académie de Lille

'https://demo.index-education.net/pronote/';\nconst username = 'demonstration';\nconst password = 'pronotevs';\n\nasync function main()\n{\n    const session = await pronote.login(url, username, password/*, cas*/);\n    \n    console.log(session.user.name); // Affiche le nom de l'élève\n    console.log(session.user.studentClass.name); // Affiche la classe de l'élève\n    \n    const timetable = await session.timetable(); // Récupérer l'emploi du temps d'aujourd'hui\n    const marks = await session.marks(); // Récupérer les notes du trimestre\n    \n    console.log(`L'élève a ${timetable.length} cours aujourd'hui`); \n    console.log(`et a pour l'instant une moyenne de ${marks.averages.student} ce trimestre.`);\n    \n    // etc. les fonctions utilisables sont 'timetable', 'marks', 'contents', 'evaluations', 'absences',\n    // 'infos', et 'menu', sans oublier les champs 'user' et 'params' qui regorgent d'informations.\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n    if (err.code === pronote.errors.WRONG_CREDENTIALS.code) {\n        console.error('Mauvais identifiants');    \n    } else {\n        console.error(err);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport { login } from 'pronote-api';\n\nasync function main()\n{\n    const session = await login(url, username, password/*, cas*/);\n    // ... Voir l'exemple JavaScript\n}\n```\n\n### Serveur GraphQL\n\n```\n$ npm i -g pronote-api\n$ pronote-api-server\n```\n\n**Note : Toutes les requêtes nécessitent la présence du header `Content-Type: application/json`**\n\nPour commencer, il faut se connecter avec une requête `POST` sur `/auth/login` contenant :\n```json\n{\n    \"url\": \"URL de l'instance Pronote\",\n    \"username\": \"Nom d'utilisateur\",\n    \"password\": \"Mot de passe\",\n    \"cas\": \"CAS (facultatif)\"\n}\n```\n\nLe serveur renverra alors une réponse de cette forme :\n```json\n{\n    \"token\": \"UN TOKEN DE SESSION\"  \n}\n```\n\nRetenez le Token, et vous pourrez appeler `POST /auth/logout` et `POST /graphql` **avec en Header `Token: LETOKEN`**,\npour cette dernière le contenu doit être un JSON avec un field `query` contenant votre requête GraphQL.\n\nExemple, pour récupérer les salles des cours du Mercredi 2 Septembre :\n```graphql\n{\n    timetable(from: \"2020-09-02\") {\n        room   \n    }\n}\n```\n\nLe schéma complet des requêtes et mutations se trouve [à cet endroit](https://github.com/Litarvan/pronote-api/blob/master/src/server/schema.graphql) \n\n### Au secours je n'arrive pas à m'y connecter\n\nPar défaut le serveur est ouvert sur `127.0.0.1`, vous ne pouvez donc vous y connecter que depuis la même machine\net avec cette adresse. Pour le lancer le serveur sur une autre adresse ou un autre port, utilisez\n`pronote-api-server PORT HOST`\n\n**ATTENTION : Il n'est pas prévu et probablement peu sécurisé d'ouvrir le serveur sur l'extérieur**\n\n## Conserver la session\n\nUne des nouvelles fonctionnalités de l'API est le fait de pouvoir garder la session envie indéfiniment.\nIl suffit pour ça d'utiliser la fonction `session.setKeepAlive(true);` (ou la mutation `mutation { setKeepAlive(enabled: true) }`).\n\n**ATTENTION : Les sessions dureront à l'infini tant que `session.setKeepAlive(false);` ne sera pas appelé ou le programme arrêté\n(dans le cas du serveur, `mutation { setKeepAlive(enabled: false) }` appelé, `/auth/logout` exécuté ou le serveur arrêté).**\n\n## API bas niveau\n\nIl est très possible que quelque chose dont vous ayez besoin ne soit pas renvoyé par l'API, pas de panique. L'API bas\nniveau permet d'accéder à tout : Les fonctions 'fetch' exportées (fetchHomeworks, fetchTimetable, etc.) permettent\nde récupérer la réponse complète de Pronote simplement traduite sans traitement supplémentaire.\n\nSi jamais une requête dont vous avez besoin n'est pas exportée, vous pouvez utiliser la fonction 'request' qui permet\nde faire facilement une requête à Pronote. Et si vous voulez outrepasser/modifier la partie authentification, vous\npouvez manuellement créer une session.\n","size":448,"stargazers_count":0,"topics":[],"updated_at":"2020-09-19T15:40:50Z","visibility":"public","watchers_count":0},{"archived":false,"commits_count":1,"contributors_count":0,"created_at":"2020-10-14T12:10:38Z","default_branch":"main","description":"A

To onboard a proposal that lives outside the TC39 organization:\n\n1. Transfer your repository to the [@tc39-transfer](http://github.com/tc39-transfer) organization\n  - if you are a TC39 delegate, but not a member of that organization, please contact [@LJHarb](https://github.com/ljharb)\n2. One of the chairs ([@bterlson](https://github.com/bterlson), [@gesa](https://github.com/gesa), [@MylesBorins](https://github.com/MylesBorins), or [@robpalme](https://github.com/robpalme)) will transfer your repository to the TC39 organization the next chance they get.\n\nNote that as part of the onboarding process your repository name may be normalized. Don't worry, repo redirects will continue to work **as long as** you never create a fork, or a new repository, with the same name - although Github Pages redirects will be broken (please update your links!).\n\n[regexp-legacy]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features\n[regexp-legacy-notes]:

some, like the `eval` command, can damage your machine if anyone can use it.\nSo most of the commands are private in the bot I use.<br>\nYou can see an example of what to put into the `.env` file into the [.env.example file](./.env.example);\n\nHowever, you can still invite the bot with [this
