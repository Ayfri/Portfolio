			I started programming in 2014 by attending a conference about programming in a library.
			I first tried some beginner projects in Python with a [book](https://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Livre/python-pour-les-kids-9782212140880) that my dad bought me, did some beginner projects, etc.

			After that, I created random projects I found on YouTube, such as programming a Minecraft-like game in C++ or making some little games in Unity.
			However, I found myself mostly copying the tutorials without attempting to create projects on my own, and therefore didn't have a deep understanding of what I was doing.

			In 2015, I created my first project with a Graphical User Interface using the [Processing](https://processing.org) software and programming language.
			I heard about this program from watching videos from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain). I created a lot of little experiments using this library and learned some interesting things about 3D graphics, how it works, how to optimise it, etc.
			My biggest 3D experiment was a [Minecraft-like](https://github.com/Ayfri/ProceCraft) game, and my most significant program with Processing was a tool to convert an [image into Minecraft Pixel-Art](https://github.com/Ayfri/Image2Minecraft) using only blocks from Minecraft as pixels.

			After some years of making some Discord Bots in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript), I heard that a library in JavaScript existed that was exactly like Processing, [p5.js](https://p5js.org) _(which was created by the same foundation)_, and used it for some little projects, even created a [port](https://github.com/Ayfri/TypeCraft) of the Minecraft-like game in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
			But it was too simplistic and not enough expandable for me. So I looked for another library to make my own games with more depth and customization.

			[PIXI.js](https://pixijs.com) was the library I stumbled upon, and I created a few projects with it for a long time. My first big game with it was a [2D Minecraft-like game](https://github.com/Ayfri/2d-minecraft) (again yes hehe).
			Then a [2D Portal game](https://github.com/Ayfri/portal-2d) experiment. Also, a [Cookie-Clicker-like](https://github.com/Ayfri/atom-clicker) game about atoms, Atom Clicker. And recently I'm recreating my [2D Minecraft-Game](https://github.com/Ayfri/Minekraft-2D) in Kotlin, still using PIXI, named Minekraft-2D.

			After creating my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/BySjRNQ9Je) for my community from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Ayfri), I wanted to create a Discord Bot.

			Back in the days, it was not that common to create a bot for your own community, and Discord was not so reputed. Because of that, there were no great tutorials. I got a lot of help from a Discord Server named Obelia Dev _(which doesn't even exist today)_, my friends Ghom, Loockeeer, Felons, and some others helped me a lot to understand and create my bot.

			About a year later, I was pretty good at creating a bot, but I realized that my project was kind of... ugly. So I recreated it, [AyBot 2](https://github.com/Ayfri/AyBot-2) was born in early 2019. It was pretty clean, and I wanted people to use my bot, so I changed a lot of the code, so it was working on multiple servers with configurations, etc.

			At that time, I created some other little utilities bots or test bots.

			AI has been a crucial subject these last years, a lot more since the release of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
			I have always been interested in AI, and I wanted to create my own AI or at least a project using AI.
			During June, I've made a little project using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [Compose for Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/lp/compose-multiplatform/) and the [GPT-4 API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference), name [Artificial-Infiltration](https://github.com/Ayfri/Artificial-Infiltration).
			The concept is a chat room where you can talk with five other people, but an AI is also in the room, and you have to find who is the AI.
			This was really interesting and amusing to use GPT API, but at that time I was not a pro in prompt engineering, so the AI was not that good until we switched to GPT-4, which is about 20 times more costly.

			For validating my second year at Ynov, I had to found a stage in a company for 6 weeks or more.
			But the school also proposed a stage organized by the Data Engineering teacher, so I applied for it and got accepted.

			Finally, we found other technologies to better create our project, and we started working on it.
